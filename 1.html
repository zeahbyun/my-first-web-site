    HTML is the standard markup language for creating web pages and applications.</a>
  <br>

  HyperText Markup Language is the computer language that
  facilitates website creation. The language, which has
  code words and syntax just like any other language,
  is relatively easy to comprehend and, as time goes on,
  increasingly powerful in what it allows someone to create.
  HTML continues to evolve to meet the demands and requirements
  of the Internet under the guise of the World Wide Web Consortium,
  the organization that designs and maintains the language; for instance,
  with the transition to Web 2.0.

  HyperText is the method by which Internet users navigate the web.
  By clicking on special text called hyperlinks, users are brought to new pages.
  The use of hyper means it is not linear, so users can go anywhere on the Internet
  simply by clicking on the available links. Markup is what HTML tags do to the text
  inside of them; they mark it as a specific type of text. </p> For example, markup text
  could come in the form of boldface or italicized type to draw specific attention
  to a word or phrase.
